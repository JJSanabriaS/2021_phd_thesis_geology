# AI-Based Development Support for PhD Research in Geology

AI Assistant for Rock Representation and Classification within DEM Models

## Project Overview

This project provides development and technical support for a PhD research initiative in Geology, focused on creating an AI-powered assistant for rock representation and classification inside Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations.

The system enhances geological modeling accuracy by integrating machine learning techniques with numerical simulation environments. Made with python as microservices


## Research Context

In geomechanics and geological modeling, DEM is widely used to simulate the mechanical behavior of rock masses. Accurate rock classification and representation are critical for realistic simulations of fracture propagation, stress distribution, and structural stability.

This project supports the automation and optimization of those processes using artificial intelligence.

## Objectives

    * Develop AI tools for automated rock type classification
    * Improve representation of heterogeneous rock structures in DEM
    * Assist in parameter estimation for simulation inputs
    * Reduce manual preprocessing time in geological modeling workflows

## Technical Contributions

    * Machine learning model development for rock pattern recognition
    * Data preprocessing and feature extraction from geological datasets
    * Integration of AI models into DEM simulation pipelines
    * Optimization of classification accuracy and computational efficiency
    * Support for visualization and interpretation of results
